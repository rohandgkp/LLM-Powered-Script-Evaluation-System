The number of drops they added to make a 10 milliliters sample of the blue indophenol indicator become colorless are given here: 8 drops of Overly Orange 13 drops of Luscious Lemon 33 drops of Fruitsnap (and it still didn't change color). Why didn't the indophenol change color with Fruitsnap?,Fruitsnap contains little or no vitamin C so Fruitsnap does not change the color of the indophenol.,"It did not change because it had not much vitamin C, so it would take a lot of drops.",0,10,0

Therefore the black covered box will heat up faster than the white covered box.,Yes. The black covered one is going to get hotter because black absorbs heat and white reflects the heat.,0,10,0
"Amber predicted that a black covered box would heat up faster than a white covered box. She took 2 identical shoe boxes and wrapped one with white paper and the other with black paper. She punched a hole in each box, stuck a thermometer into each hole, and put both boxes in the sun. Every 5 minutes, Amber recorded the temperature in each box. Will the data support Amber's prediction? Explain your answer.",Yes. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. White reflects more heat (energy) than black. Therefore the black covered box will heat up faster than the white covered box.,Yes. Yes because light colors will reflect the sun and black or darker colors will absorb the sun and if light or white colors reflect the sun then it will not get as much heat as the black or light colors.,0,10,0
